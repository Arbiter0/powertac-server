May 2011 beta release

This is a preview release. Some important functions are missing, but
the server and demo agent should be sufficient to get started setting
up a development and working on a broker.

The server is not currently set up to build automatically using Maven,
because the plugins have not been packaged. To run the server, you
need to install the server source and sources for all the plugins in
parallel directories. Currently the server is configured to depend on
the following plugins:

../powertac-common
../powertac-server-interface
../powertac-accounting-service
../powertac-auctioneer-pda
../powertac-distribution-utility
../powertac-household-customer
../powertac-web-app
../powertac-random
../powertac-genco
../powertac-broker-default

In addition, powertac-web-app depends on powertac-style, and shortly a
dependency will be added on powertac-physical-environment to provide
weather forecasts and reports.

The broker framework is in the github repo 
https://github.com/powertac/powertac-demo-agent-grails.git. 

The beta release versions of these components are in git branches
called release-0.2 in each repository. To access those branches, just
clone the respective repositories and do 'git checkout release-0.2' in
each one.

Significant outstanding issues from the github ticket system at
https://github.com/powertac/powertac-server/issues:

#217 - default tariffs are broadcast at the first tariff broadcast
 time, not at the beginning as they should be.

#219 - market clearing transfers funds in the wrong direction - from
 seller to buyer rather than buyer to seller.
