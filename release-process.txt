Process for creating a Power TAC release package
------------------------------------------------

- Make sure your master branch is up to date. Because of the need to
  change the config in the release, you don't what to have to merge from
  the release back to the master.

- Make sure the plugin.xml file is NOT in the master branch. That gets
  created automatically during the packaging process on the release
  branch, and does not need to be committed.

- On the master branch, update plugin version id in each plugin that
  has changed since last release.

- Make sure your .grails/settings.groovy contains your repository
  credentials.

- Install the maven-publisher plugin, even if it's already there.

- Once the master branch is in good shape, commit and push it.

- For each plugin, sorted topologically by dependency (start with
  common and random, which have no dependencies):

  - Create a new branch for the release (such as release-0.3) in the
    server and each plugin (git checkout -b release-0.3).

  - test and commit locally.

  - in BuildConfig.groovy, remove the
    grails.project.dependency.distribution clause.

  - in server/../BuildConfig.groovy, remove the local plugin dependencies, and
    replace them with repository dependencies using
    install-plugin. It's not necessary to do this for the plugins,
    because they will not be used independently.

  - publish as
    > grails maven-deploy --repository=powertacPlugins
